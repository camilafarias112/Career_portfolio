Applying sequencing approaches and bioinformatics to investigate host immune genetic signatures in infectious diseases.
- Illumina Next-generation sequencing platform to investigate multiple organism omics signatures from biological samples.
- R/Rstudio statistical tools to interrogate transcriptomic alterations associated with the skin infectious disease caused by Leishmania spp. in humans and experimental models.

Shared Postdoctoral researcher and Teaching assistant in the Center for Host-Microbial Interactions (CHMI) for sequencing and Omics analysis.
- Teaching transcriptomics analysis using the R programming language - 32 hrs as teaching assistant per semester course; 1 hr weekly private meetings with students; virtual support through Slack messenger app.

PhD in Immunology focused in investigate the role of Natural Killer cells it's cytotoxic-related pathways in the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection.
- Cell culture and flow cytometry were primarily used as wet lab techniques.
- Close contact with human subjects, experience with clinical and biological sample collection.

Master in Immunology focused in understand the role of innate immune cells (monocytes and macrophages) in the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection.
- Flow cytometry, cell culture, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used as wet lab techniques to investigate questions.

- Awarded in 2017 with a Ph.D sandwich-scholarship to develop a scientific research project abroad - by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES, Brazil).
- Used Illumina sequencing platform in biological human samples (peripheral blood and skin biopsies) from patients infected by Leishmania spp. to investigate host transcriptomic profiles associated with this infectious disease.
- Beginner in using R statistical analysis de perform Omics Analysis.

      <b>2018-current</b> - I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in <a href="https://twitter.com/pscottlab" target="_blank">Dr. Phillip Scott</a> and <a href="https://hostmicrobe.org" target="_blank">Dr. Dan Beiting</a>'s lab in the Department of Pathobiology at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn).
      I investigate Next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from experimental models and human patients with American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis.
      I have been using my Immunology and Cell Biology background to find expression patterns in those datasets that contribute to understanding the immune system in the infections caused by the protozoan <i>Leishmania spp</i>.</p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I am a teaching assistant in the <a href="http://diytranscriptomics.com" target="_blank">DIYtranscriptomics.com</a> course at UPenn.
      </p>
      <p><b>2017</b> -  I was awarded a Ph.D. fellow scholarship to learn a new science field abroad.
        Under Dr. Dan Beiting and Dr. Phillip Scott's supervision at UPenn, I started my journey in Bioinformatics and Computational biology.
      </p>
      
      <p><b>2012-2017</b>- Throughout these years, I worked on my Master's and Ph.D. degrees in Immunology and Health Sciences under MD Dr. Edgar M. Carvalho's mentoring in the Hospital of Clinics and Federal Universitiy of Bahia.
        I worked closely with human patients infected by the protozoan parasite <i>Leishmania spp.</i> and by the retrovirus Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) to understand the clinical relevance of those infections, and also used cellular and molecular biology <i>-wet lab-</i> technics to characterize and understand the role of Innate and Adaptative immune cells in the defense to those pathogens.
      </p>
      <p><b>2011</b> - I graduated from the Escola Bahiana de Medicina in Salvador-Bahia-Brazil with a. B.S. in Biomedical Sciences.
