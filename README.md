# Material for my career portfolio

In this repo, I have rmarkdowns, Rscripts, and plots that are used in my [website](https://camilafarias112.github.io/), including the ggplot showing my timeline as a scientist. This image was inspired by [Isabella Benabaye](https://github.com/isabellabenabaye/life-chart/) and [Sharla Gelfand](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/mylifeinmonths)\!
